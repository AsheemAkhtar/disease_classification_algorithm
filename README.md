# disease_classification_algorithm
Its a program to predict disease on the basis of given symptoms
IMPORTANT POINTS:-
- In this task i was asked to create a tool to predict the disease of Ms Sara & i was asked to tell the likelihood of it being Covid or Malaria but I ADDED MORE DISEASE
- it is mentioned in task that she had only two symptoms but this program can intake 7 SYMPTOMS as inputs
- only covid symptom dataset was available online & malaria's dataset contained microscopic images only
- i created malaria's dataset mannually by studying it's symptoms online which was quite time consuming
- I also added flu symptom dataset
